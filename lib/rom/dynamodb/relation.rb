    # that are often repeated throughout your code base, or those which need to be
    # tested in isolation.

    # Below is a guided example for creating, updating, deleting and querying
    # information for a simple `User` table that consists of an `:id` key in the
    # form of a hash.

    # table that contains a composite key, made up of `:host` and `:timestamp`,
    # which form the hash and range parts of the key, respectively.
